* Experiments
** Plan

Going to use the new features and experimental protocol from the
060412 test in order to do the mixture experiments, and the parts
experiments.  Going to also run more patterns and get results for all
of those.

I'm also going to implement the feature computation of Muhammed waliji

** 2-component Mixture
The relevant file is in 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Experiments/061112/redo_mixture_experiments.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

We give a visual comparison betweenn the different mixture components:

#+CAPTION: Spectrogram
#+LABEL: fig:spec1
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=25em
[[./spec_raw.eps]]

** extract_local_features.py

Getting the computation with the indices to work
Given a spectrogram S which has a height and a width we need to compute the local patches
