The main idea is to construct a directory for each phone in timit and
we'll have a fast method for loading some subset of the files in there
in order to do classification.  It will be a working directory and
maybe we do cleanup afterwords.

The main thing that we want is to have fast read times, the trick to that
is going to be to use memmap.

So within Test we will have a matrix saved there for each of the
phones those will get loaded in in some way, the main thought being
that we'll have a three-d matrix and then do some padding at the end
so that all the examples are the same length
the padding should be obvious so that way we don't do recognition
using the padding (if the features are binary the padding can be 2's)
