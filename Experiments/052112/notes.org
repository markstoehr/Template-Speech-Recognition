* Experiments
The order of experiments is for me to first make sure that the system
gets a reasonable ROC curve for the "aar" and "liy" experiments

Then we want to do ROC curves for "pa" v.s. "ta" v.s. "da"
we also want ROC curves for "aa", "iy", "u" and other vowels

** AAR experiment
its contained in aar_experiment.py
